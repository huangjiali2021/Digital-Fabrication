         <H2>What do I want to do</H2>
          <P>I want to achieve haptic and force feedback in VR to enhance the perception of body parts in virtual space.  
             <br>So, I decided to create a VR mechanical glove that allows people to build blocks with their hands in VR and feel the force feedback when holding the blocks.

         <H2>How do I achieve it?</H2>

                <h3>Building Blocks Stage</h3>
                <p><strong>3D Assets: </strong>Model and create materials in Blender, create shaders in Unity.
                    <br><strong>Interaction Code: </strong>Implement 3D model additions, deletions, rotation, scaling, proportional changes, and copy-paste using C# code. Implement zooming in and out, and rotation of the view.
                    <br><strong>Computer Vision: </strong>Design and recognize hand gestures within VR to complete the aforementioned operations.
                </p>
                <h3>Force Feedback Stage</h3>
                <p><strong>Communication: </strong>Achieve the positioning and interaction of the physical glove within VR.
                    <br><strong>Data Analysis: </strong>Determine which model grip points and gestures correspond to which force limits on the glove.
                    <br><strong>Arduino: </strong>Use flex sensors, motors, and other components to collect gesture data and provide force feedback.
                    <br><strong>Manufacturing: </strong>Design the glove's mechanical structure, use 3D printing and laser cutting to produce the glove.
                    <br><strong>Agentic AI: </strong>An intelligent system that automatically judges the user's gestures and movement intentions, adjusting the virtual blocks' responses (e.g., aligning, rotating, adjusting the best position for the blocks, or displaying assistive tips).
