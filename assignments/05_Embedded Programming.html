                <h2>MCU</h2>
                <p>A microcontroller(MCU) is a small, low-cost computer integrated into a single chip, designed to control electronic devices. It consists of a processor(CPU), memory(RAM and flash storage), and input/output peripherals(e.g., GPIP pins, timers, and communication interfaces). MCUs are commonly used in embedded systems, where they provide specific functionality for various applications.</p>
                <p>Microcontroller can be used in creating robotics, home automation systems, wearables, sensors, and IoT devices. With an MCU, you can control motors, reader sensors, process data, and communicate with other devices. Popular examples include Arduino, Raspberry Pi Pico, and ESP32. </p>
