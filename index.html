            <H2>What do I want to do</H2>
                <P>I want to achieve haptic and force feedback in VR to enhance the perception of body parts in virtual space.  
                 <br>So, I decided to create a VR mechanical glove that allows people to build blocks with their hands in VR and feel the force feedback when holding the blocks.

                       <h3>Building Blocks Stage</h3>
                       <p><strong>3D Assets: </strong>Model and create materials in Blender, create shaders in Unity.
                           <br><strong>Interaction Code: </strong>Implement 3D model additions, deletions, rotation, scaling, proportional changes, and copy-paste using C# code. Implement zooming in and out, and rotation of the view.
                           <br><strong>Computer Vision: </strong>Design and recognize hand gestures within VR to complete the aforementioned operations.
                       </p>
                       <h3>Force Feedback Stage</h3>
                       <p><strong>Communication: </strong>Achieve the positioning and interaction of the physical glove within VR.
                           <br><strong>Data Analysis: </strong>Determine which model grip points and gestures correspond to which force limits on the glove.
                           <br><strong>Arduino: </strong>Use flex sensors, motors, and other components to collect gesture data and provide force feedback.
                           <br><strong>Manufacturing: </strong>Design the glove's mechanical structure, use 3D printing and laser cutting to produce the glove.
                           <br><strong>OpenBCI: </strong>Monitor emotions and focus levels, and generate interactive responses in the environment and through haptic feedback based on data such as brainwaves, heart rate, etc.
