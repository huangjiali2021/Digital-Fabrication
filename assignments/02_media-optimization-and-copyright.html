                <p>Nowadays, the form and content of web pages are very diverse, project files can be embedded within the text, images, video, links, code and other resources, images are generally png, jpg, webp and other formats, of which webp is very adaptable to the web page side, png can be a transparent channel, jpg is more general, video is usually mp4 format, there are other formats such as GIF, etc., and now the development of the web page usually use html, css, javascript are used for text frames, graphic styles and dynamic interactions respectively.</p>
                <h2>Version2.0 -- Ffmpeg</h2>
                <p>I use <a href="https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/"><strong>ffmpeg</strong></a>, a multi-media processing command-line tool library,</p> to compress the video/image and convert its format.
                <p>I add ffmpeg in environment variables so that I can run ffmpeg directly in command line(cmd).</p>

                    <p>I used PR to cut out 10 seconds of a two-minute video, totalling 12MB, and then used the FlexClip website to compress the video online, totalling 811KB FlexClip-This video compression tool supports many formats such as, MP4, MOV, M4V and so on. Don't worry about privacy and security. They don't get access to your uploaded video files. It is completely free to use their compressed video. There will be no watermark on the compressed video as well. At the same time, Adobe's PR software as a professional video processing software is very good, he can complete a number of composite tasks such as editing, compression, etc., very suitable for professionals. </p>
                    <p>It is unethical to put creators' creations into the AI big model database regardless of their wishes, and AI-generated content that is indistinguishable from human-generated content or facts will result in a huge loss to human civilisation, I support badging human-generated content and letting the creators decide whether or not their own creations will be allowed to be assimilated by the AI.</p>
