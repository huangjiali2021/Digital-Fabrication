  <h1>Jiali-Huang does Digital Fabrication!</h1>
  <h3>The website documents all my learning processes and materials at the Digital Fabrication Lab.</h3>
  <p>Summarise the overall experience - as an interaction designer who creates designs that combine the physical and the digital, I learnt c# code, Unity and Arduino, sensors, 3D printing, laser cutting and other technologies to complete the projects I wanted to do!</p>
  <p>I hope to learn the technologiy skills like data collection & analysis/ electronic communication/ sensors/ coding/ machine learning from zero so that I can implement what I want to do.</p>
  <p>And I can improve the skills that I already have like 3D modle/ 3D rendering/ engine interaction/ project research & formulation.</p>
